## Features

- **Dynamic Countdown**: Displays days, hours, minutes, and seconds until the next New Year.
- **Automatic Year Update**: Automatically updates the target year and restarts the countdown after the current year ends.
- **Celebration Animation**: Displays a "Happy New Year!" message with a festive animation when the countdown reaches zero.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

## How It Works

1. The application calculates the time remaining until the next New Year (`January 1` of the following year).
2. The countdown updates every second, displaying the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
3. When the countdown reaches zero:
   - A "Happy New Year!" message is displayed with a celebration animation.
   - The animation runs for **30 minutes** and then stops.
   - The countdown automatically restarts for the next year.
